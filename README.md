# Data_projects_tripleten

Projects I worked on while attending the Business Intelligence Analysis program at #TripleTen


|Project|Title|Description|
|:----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|
|1|Advanced Spreadsheets| This is an exploration of Airbnb data in New York City.  Tasked with the objective of identifying profitible boroughs and neighborhoods.  Within those neighborhoods exploratory analysis in Google sheets was used to identify popular properties in terms of their active use.  With these starting points, I compiled a list of profitible properties, in prime locations that would be suitable for acquistion.    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/132xGivB-duWPg5_pOAGmZGVDP6QhYv5Exox8gQ0Top8/edit?usp=sharing |
